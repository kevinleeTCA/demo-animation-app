This is the demo I used for the Melboure React meetup (26/10/2017) https://www.meetup.com/React-Melbourne/events/243898983/

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

This app contains 3 demos:

DemoOne: Using TransitionGroup to hook up the animation

DemoTwo: Prove that put wrapper Box in TransitionGroup will not make animation work

DemoThree: Using react-move to do layout animation, TweeMax to do triggered animation.
